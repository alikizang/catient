        # Note: Since we are using App Hosting (Cloud Build) now, this workflow is technically for Firebase Hosting (Classic).
        # But if you want to keep using this GH Action to deploy to "Hosting", we need these vars.
        # However, for "App Hosting", the build happens on Google Cloud, not here.
        # Given your setup, you seem to be using App Hosting (backend).
        # This workflow might be redundant or conflicting if you enabled App Hosting GitHub integration.
        # But fixing it won't hurt.
